        <p>
          Singapore-based news portal The Online Citizen (TOC) has temporarily
          closed its website and social media accounts after its license was
          suspended by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) for
          alleged failure to reveal its foreign funders.
        </p>
        <p>
          IMDA’s order was denounced by media freedom advocates as another
          example of Singapore’s restrictive policy governing independent media.
        </p>
        <p>
          TOC has faced threats from the government in the past but this is the
          first time that the news portal was forced to cease operating.
        </p>
        <p>
          IMDA explained why it was important to ensure that political websites
          do not receive foreign funding:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            This is to prevent such sites from being controlled by, or coming
            under the influence of foreign entities or funding, and ensure that
            there is no foreign influence in domestic politics.
          </p>
          <p>
            We need to be cautious as the prevalence of the Internet and social
            media platforms makes it easier to influence large numbers of
            people.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          IMDA is suspicious of TOC’s subscription model since it can be a
          method for foreign interests to influence the operations of the
          company:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            One element of TOC’s subscription framework allowed “subscribers” to
            get specific articles written, in return for “subscription funding”
            received. This is a cause for concern as it could be an avenue for
            foreign influence.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          On its now-deleted donation page, TOC offers subscribers the
          opportunity to pay for opinion pieces, investigative reports, and
          feature stories.
        </p>
        <p>
          TOC editor Terry Xu clarified that the subscription feature of the
          website does not affect their editorial work. He insisted that this
          revenue generation model cannot be considered advertising:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            In this case, you have patrons, subscribers, who are more
            supportive, going for that tier, and they could play a part in terms
            of the kind of stories that TOC would carry.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Lim Tean, a member of TOC’s legal team criticized IMDA for nitpicking
          on the subscription model of the news company:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            You have tried to interfere with TOC's business model by alleging
            that their subscription model cannot be justified and therefore all
            their subscribers must be treated as donors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your stance on this issue is highly questionable and suspect. Even
            after our client provided exhaustive evidence to you of how their
            subscribers benefit from the subscription model, you continued to
            insist that there is no evidence to prove the authenticity of the
            subscription model.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Terry Xu added that IMDA’s actions reflected the government’s hardline
          approach in dealing with independent media outlets like TOC:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            IMDA's actions are nothing more than means of harassment and
            intimidation of the free press in Singapore. With Singapore's firm
            grasp on digital financial transactions, it is impossible for the
            government not to be aware of where the funds are coming from.
          </p>
          <p>
            The licensing regime is simply meant to strike fear in the minds of
            the would-be donors and subscribers to prevent them from supporting
            independent journalism in Singapore.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          After the closure of the TOC website and its social media accounts,
          many Singaporeans expressed concern about the chilling effect of this
          incident. Journalist Kirsten Han acknowledged the role of TOC in
          publishing reports not covered by the mainly pro-government mainstream
          media websites:
        </p>
        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
          <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
            TOC has provided space for issues that wouldn&#39;t have had space
            elsewhere. Its presence, its work, *has* shifted the needle.
            It&#39;s pushed the mainstream media to cover (or do a better job
            covering) issues like migrant workers&#39; rights, which is now
            quite commonly reported on.

          Daniel Bastard of Reporters Without Borders noted that TOC is being
          singled out because of its critical reporting:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Let's not be fooled: the pro-government newspapers and news sites
            that constitute most of the Singaporean media are entirely exempt
            from the IMDA’s requests, unlike TOC, which is subjected to endless
            harassment. The site is clearly being made to pay for its editorial
            independence.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Terry Xu assured TOC’s followers that the website’s closure was just a
          temporary setback:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Contrary to expectation, there will be no sad statements of how TOC
            is being forced to close after nearly 15 years of operations as I
            assure you that this is just a temporary suspension of its
            operations and a time of reflection for TOC to look at how it can
            better improve itself in order to serve Singaporeans, its supporters
            and the greater public.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Through its legal representative, TOC has already asked the court to
          conduct a judicial review of the suspension order issued by IMDA.
